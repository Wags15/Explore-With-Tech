# Explore-With-Tech

This project was made for the 2021 Surfs Up hackathon hosted by MLH. It allows you to explore and interact with many different vacation spots around the world to fully immerse yourself in the location before you book it. It also links you to a site to book any location that you like by clicking on the name of said location above the model. 

All images for the locations were found on https://www.humus.name/index.php?page=Textures&start=0.
